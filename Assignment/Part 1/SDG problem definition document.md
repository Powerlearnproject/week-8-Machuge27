#### **2. Problem Definition**
- **Problem**: **Low student performance in rural schools due to lack of access to quality teaching resources and infrastructure.**
  - **Description**: In many rural areas, students face significant challenges in achieving academic success due to inadequate access to quality teaching resources (e.g., textbooks, ebooks, computers, and trained teachers) and poor school infrastructure (e.g., lack of electricity, lack of internet access, proper classrooms, and sanitation facilities). These factors contribute to lower student performance compared to urban schools.
  - **Impact**: Low student performance perpetuates cycles of poverty, limits future opportunities, and widens the educational gap between rural and urban populations.
  - **Data-Driven Solution**: By analyzing data on student performance, school resources, and infrastructure, we can identify gaps and propose targeted interventions to improve educational outcomes in rural schools.

#### **3. Objectives**
- **Primary Objective**: To analyze the relationship between student performance, access to teaching resources, and school infrastructure in rural schools.
- **Secondary Objectives**:
  - Identify schools with the lowest performance and resource gaps.
  - Propose data-driven recommendations to improve access to quality education in rural areas.

---

#### **4. Key Questions to Address**
1. What is the average student performance in rural schools compared to urban schools?
2. How does the availability of teaching resources (e.g., textbooks, computers) correlate with student performance?
3. What is the impact of school infrastructure (e.g., electricity, classrooms) on student outcomes?
4. Which schools require the most urgent interventions to improve student performance?

---

#### **5. Expected Outcomes**
- A clear understanding of the factors contributing to low student performance in rural schools.
- Data-driven insights to guide policymakers and educators in allocating resources effectively.
- Recommendations for improving school infrastructure and access to teaching resources in rural areas.
